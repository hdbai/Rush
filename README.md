# Rush
ECS150 Project

Introduction

A shell is a command interpreter for the system. On many Linux systems, bash is the
default interactive shell, and dash is the default script interpreter. In this homework, you
will implement a subset of dash called rush. You will learn system calls for process
management and inter-process communications (IPC).
